                staircase’s airy well.</h3>

            <p>Hassabis, 46, has always been obsessed with intelligence: what it is, the possibilities it unlocks, and
                how to acquire more of it. He was the second-best chess player in the world for his age when he was 12,
                and he graduated from high school a year early. As an adult he strikes a somewhat diminutive figure, but
                his intellectual presence fills the room. “I want to understand the big questions, the really big ones
                that you normally go into philosophy or physics if you’re interested in,” he says. “I thought building
                AI would be the fastest route to answer some of those questions.”</p>
